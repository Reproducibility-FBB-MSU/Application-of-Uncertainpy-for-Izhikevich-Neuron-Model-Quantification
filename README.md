# Application of Uncertainpy for Izhikevich Neuron Model Quantification
Authors: Anton Izzi, Stanislav Tikhonov, Anton Vlasov.
<br>
In this project we used Uncertainpy module for Python to quantify Izhikevich neuron models with different parameters to evaluate the module's quality.

## Ð¡ontibution of authors:
<b>Anton Izzi</b> created a clear annotation for uq_izhikevich_function.py in .ipynb file with a prompt description of main parameters used.
<br>
<b>Stanislav Tikhonov</b> performed literature review giving important information on using the Uncertainpy module and making a comprehensible presentation of it and Izhikevich neuron model.
<br>
<b>Anton Vlasov</b> wrote Main.ipynb notebook to quantify neuron models with different parameters using uq_izhikevich_function.py and ran the program on his computer providing the results.

The authors declare no conflict of interests. The following files (uq_izhikevich_function.py and izhikevich_function.py) were taken from /Uncertainpy/examples repository.
